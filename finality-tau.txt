Finality Tau Announcements
Patch 04a5 has been released with the addition of the
Cave Dweller, the missing piece to the experience. Please
update to it as soon as possible!

I have identified one cause of the error log being flooded
on the server pack, it is Deeper and Darker by KyaniteMods.
Deeper and Darker will be removed in patch 04a4.

Patch 04a3 has been released, please update as soon as
possible for fixes and removal of the annoying night
noises.

From the Cjbeards Music Usage spreadsheet:
All my music is royalty-free to use for YouTube and streaming,
and most of my music (See the "Credits & Free Use" sheet) is
also royalty-free to use for film, advertisements, video games,
etc. but you must give credit in the proper way and to the right
people.

A note from the modpack author, CelestialAbyss:
All the songs listed above are Free to Use, but I will extensively
give credit where it is due. Links to the songs are attached on
the modpack's GitHub wiki page.
