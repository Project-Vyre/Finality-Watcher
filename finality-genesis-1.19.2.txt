Hi! This is now a live web source which means any 
announcements from us will appear here! Credits are at the
bottom of this text body.

------------

The 0.2.1-build.41 has been uploaded to CurseForge, though it
has triggered a manual review. Please be patient and keep
checking!

Iron's Spells n' Spellbooks also had a major update but I am
saving it for the 1.20.1 port of this modpack. See you soon!

From the Cjbeards Music Usage spreadsheet:
All my music is royalty-free to use for YouTube and streaming,
and most of my music (See the "Credits & Free Use" sheet) is
also royalty-free to use for film, advertisements, video games,
etc. but you must give credit in the proper way and to the right
people.

From Farabi Hasan Music:
Feel free to use my mix as a BGM for your contents, 
but do please leave credits! HOWEVER, a repost of my mix 
(except if you leave my channel link and credit me) and/or 
extending it is prohibited.

A note from the modpack author, CelestialAbyss:
All the songs by Cjbeards listed above are Free to Use, but I 
will extensively give credit where it is due.
