Finality Genesis Live Channel & Credits
Hi! This is now a live web source which means any 
announcements from us will appear here! Credits are at the
bottom of this text body.
------------
0.2.1-build.39 is now out! Enjoy!

0.2.0-build.39 has been changed to 0.2.1-build.39.
However, the update may take longer due to performance
issues I keep running into under specific conditions
that may require an increase in allocated RAM.


0.2.0-build.39 will be addressing some recipe conflicts
that were not expected, apologies if you were experiencing
issues with creating Unstable Entropy Particles! However
this update is going to be delayed due to a few "small"
changes in how my scripts are organized and updates
from mod authors. Apologies for the wait!

All my music is royalty-free to use for YouTube and streaming,

also royalty-free to use for film, advertisements, video games,
etc. but you must give credit in the proper way and to the right
people.

Feel free to use my mix as a BGM for your contents, 
but do please leave credits! HOWEVER, a repost of my mix

A note from the modpack author, CelestialAbyss:
All the songs by Cjbeards listed above are Free to Use, but I 
will extensively give credit where it is due.
