Finality Genesis Live Channel & Credits
Hi! This is now a live web source which means any 
announcements from us will appear here! Credits are at the
bottom of this text body.
------------
0.2.0-build.31 is now live! Please update to it as it
addresses an issue with the Aether mod causing a crash
whenever you attempt to join a server.

Also, there seems to be a new issue with FTB Quests not
detecting items from players' inventories despite
there being no special conditions while in a dedicated
server environment. This DOES NOT apply to players who
host multiplayer sessions through Essential or LAN!
------------
Full release for 0.2 is now out! However, Malum 
does add new structures. Soyou will either have to generate 
newchunks or re-generate your world usingthe same seed.

Either way, backup everything via schematic and you should 
be fine!
