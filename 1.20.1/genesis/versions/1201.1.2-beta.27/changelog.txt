Putting back JEI as the default recipe viewer due to problems introduced by REI even with instructions to resolve those issues... Sometimes the plugin reload didn't work for some users. Hopefully Dan can fix the issues at some point ;-;

> [!IMPORTANT]
> So the code I wrote to make Netherite, Iridium and High Entropy Alloy tools works in Singleplayer but not Multiplayer... This is fine. `*sarcasm*` Solution #2 has been implemented in the form of a recipe involving Create's Blocks of Experience.

> [!WARNING]
> A few mods have been removed in this update, so some blocks and items may be missing such as Create blocks, all of Destroy's blocks and items... Yeah. This may be *very* inconvenient.

### Fixed

- 2024.08.26
  - Edit: Create Enchantable Machinery has been removed. ~~Fixed the new enchantable Create Drills not having the ability to break blocks in claimed chunks. Please note that you may have to copy and paste `openpartiesandclaims-server.toml` from the `defaultconfigs` folder and put it into your world's `serverconfig` folder. Make sure to put it in the same folder location as the original config for OPAC or this will not work then hit **Ctrl** + **S** to save changes in your text editor or notepad.~~

### Added

- 2024.09.03
  - Added a recipe that makes tools unbreakable when combined with Create's Blocks of Experience. Please note that it will reset all NBT data so you will have to apply all of your enchantments again!
