# Finality Genesis 1.20.1 Feed

Hello and welcome to the 1.20.1 port of Finality Genesis. This text body changes whenever I update it on the GitHub repository, so stay tuned for live updates from here! Date format is in YYYY.MM.DD.

## 2024.01.05

Updates are going to be on hold to prioritize development on Finality Mote 1.20.1. Apologies for any bugs that continue to persist, such as the original recipe for the Mechanical Extruder no longer being overriden due to a mod update.

## 2024.09.28

Finality Genesis update 1201.1.2-beta.27 has been uploaded to CurseForge, but I will most likely not be active for some time. The SMP server has also been archived for the time being.

## 2024.09.19

I will be shifting my attention towards porting Finality Mote to 1.20.1. As for update 0.1.2-beta.27, it's *almost* ready.
However, the SMP server will be reset once the port for Finality Mote on 1.20.1 is released and will also run on it. Let's just say Finality Genesis has once again become too big to run on a server in a stable manner despite having very similar mod lists. Apologies for any further inconveniences!

## 2024.08.25

So I released update 0.1.1.-beta.26 and the script that adds the unbreakable NBT data to tools doesn't work on dedicated Multiplayer servers... A patch will be released hopefully soon once I figure it out.
Another PSA: Drills may require you to turn off block protection in claimed chunks due to Create: Enchantable Machinery modifying drills. Sorry for the inconvenience!

If you currently have issues trying to play with friends, disable **Simple Discord RPC** as it causes severe lag when connecting directly to servers instead of connecting from a saved server entry. Update 0.1.1-beta.22 addresses this.

## 2024.07.23

Notice: Soooo uhhh... 0.1.1-beta.23 did not actually fix the True Final Singularity recipe. Stay tuned for a patch after more testing has been done!
