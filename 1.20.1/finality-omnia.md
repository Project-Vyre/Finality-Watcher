# Finality Omnia 1.20.1 Feed

Hello and welcome to the 1.20.1 port of Finality Omnia, featuring Create update 6!
Please be aware that the 1.20.1 port is currently in open alpha, so expect bugs.

Currently, Create registry tooltips will need to be replaced. A drop in replacement is unfortunately not available, however.

Tooltips on items will be missing for a while as they are migrated to KubeJS's tooltip system away from Create's tooltip registry.

Stay tuned for more updates!

## Known Issues

- Fireball entities cause an entity ticking crash only in dedicated server environments. Thankfully, this is mitigated by Neruina.
