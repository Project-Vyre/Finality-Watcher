The spawn egg acquisition update and recipe cost readjusting. Unfortunately, Create tooltips are broken with an unknown cause that I can't determine.

This modpack will not be updating to Create 6.0.0 immediately as many things have been broken and will need to be redone, apologies for the inconvenience caused.

### Fixed

- 2025.01.18
  - Fixed Celestisynth Starlit Factory
- 2025.01.05
  - Added missing black pixels to the vanilla enchanting GUI texture.
- 2024.12.31
  - Fixed train directional arrow being too large. This is due to Create's Placement Assist size scaling being deliberately linked to this for whatever reason.
- 2024.12.29
  - Fixed FTB Quests node "Tutorial - Part 2" giving a quiver and bow that you already made to complete it. 4 AM braincells.

### Added

- 2024.12.29
  - Added Deconstructor recipes for the following items:
    - Chest Minecart
    - Furnace Minecart
    - TNT Minecart
    - Hopper Minecart
    - Dispenser Minecart (Supplementaries)
    - Jukebox Minecart (Etched)
