> [!NOTICE]
> I am well aware Alex's Caves has recently added its Candy Caves biome, but the jawbreakers unfortunately generate in a way that replaces Bedrock with breakable blocks. This is undesired and thus the mod will not be updated until this issue is addressed by the mod author. I will patiently wait for additional bugfixes before updating Alex's Caves.

> [!NOTICE]
> Alex's Caves has now released an update addressing the above feature. Alex's Caves has now been updated.
