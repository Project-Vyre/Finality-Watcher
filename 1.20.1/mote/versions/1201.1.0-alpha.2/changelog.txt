> [!NOTICE]
> I am well aware Alex's Caves has recently added its Candy Caves biome, but the jawbreakers unfortunately generate in a way that replaces Bedrock with breakable blocks. This is undesired and thus the mod will not be updated until this issue is addressed by the mod author. I will patiently wait for additional bugfixes before updating Alex's Caves.

### Fixed

- 2024.10.21
  - Fixed the GUI texture for the Grindstone having a white pixel in the corner that I forgot to remove.
- 2024.10.20
  - Fixed Oh the Biome's We've Gone stripped logs not working with Create's item application recipes for making casings. This is due to the original mod author not generating the item and block tags when Create is present as the `forge:stripped_logs` tag is not created by Forge but is actually generated by Create.
  - Fixed Oh the Biome's We've Gone planks not able to craft vanilla chests. This is due to Quark's Variant Chests feature.
  - Fixed the recipe for making the Tome of Finality still showing up in-game. It should no longer show up.

### Added

- 2024.10.21
  - Athena was added to enable AE2's connected textures.
