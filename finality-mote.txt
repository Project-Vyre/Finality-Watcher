From the Cjbeards Music Usage spreadsheet:
All my music is royalty-free to use for YouTube and streaming,
and most of my music (See the "Credits & Free Use" sheet) is
also royalty-free to use for film, advertisements, video games,
etc. but you must give credit in the proper way and to the right
people.

A note from the modpack author, CelestialAbyss:
All the songs listed above are Free to Use, but I will extensively
give credit where it is due. Links to the songs are attached on
the modpack's GitHub wiki page.
