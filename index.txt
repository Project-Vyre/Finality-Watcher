\n From the Cjbeards Music Usage spreadsheet:
\n All my music is royalty-free to use for YouTube and streaming,
\n and most of my music (See the "Credits & Free Use" sheet) is
\n also royalty-free to use for film, advertisements, video games,
\n etc. but you must give credit in the proper way and to the right
\n people.

\n A note from the modpack author, CelestialAbyss:
\n All the songs listed above are Free to Use, but I will extensively
\n give credit where it is due. Links to the songs are attached on
\n the modpack's GitHub wiki page.
