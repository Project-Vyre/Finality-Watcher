Finality Genesis Live Channel & Credits
Version 0.1.3b will fix the log being flooded with my damage
cancellation script.
Version 0.1.3 has been released on CF, but the removal
of Spice of Life: Carrot Edition may leave your health lower
than usual. If this happens, all you need to do is:
/attribute @s generic.max_health base set 10
/attribute @s generic.max_health set 10
Then simply respawn and hopefully your health resets back to
normal. 
I have found the cause as to why FTB Quests no longer displays
recipes... Compatibility with JEI / REI was moved to a 
seperate mod called FTB XMod Compat. Quest rework is going to
start from Finality Genesis, so it will take some time to
synchronize all the changes.

Patch C for 0.1.2 is now available, update soon!

Hi! This is now a live web source which means
