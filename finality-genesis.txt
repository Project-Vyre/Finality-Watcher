Finality Genesis Live Channel & Credits
Hi! This is now a live web source which means any 
announcements from us will appear here! Credits are at the
bottom of this text body.

PSA: If items have double tooltips, type the following command:
/kubejs reload client_scripts

This issue is outside of my control and is being looked into
by the KubeJS team.

0.1.4 Patch F has been merged into 0.2.0 due to the amount of
changes, it's also far too large for 0.1.5.
0.1.4 Patch E has reinstated JEI as the default recipe manager.
Version 0.1.4 has been released, with JEI being replaced by REI.
Version 0.1.3e has been released on CurseForge.
Version 0.1.3b will fix the log being flooded with my damage
cancellation script.
Version 0.1.3 has been released on CF, but the removal
of Spice of Life: Carrot Edition may leave your health lower
than usual. If this happens, all you need to do is:
/attribute @s generic.max_health base set 10
/attribute @s generic.max_health set 10
Then simply respawn and hopefully your health resets back to
normal. 
I have found the cause as to why FTB Quests no longer displays
recipes... Compatibility with JEI / REI was moved to a 
seperate mod called FTB XMod Compat. Quest rework is going to
start from Finality Genesis, so it will take some time to
synchronize all the changes.

Patch C for 0.1.2 is now available, update soon!
